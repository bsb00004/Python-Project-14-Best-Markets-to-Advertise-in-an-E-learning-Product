Finding the Two Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product

## Python Project 14:-  Finding the Two Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product

In this project, we'll aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.

### Understanding the Data
To avoid spending money on organizing a survey, we'll first try to make use of existing data to determine whether we can reach any reliable result.

One good candidate for our purpose is [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run [a popular Medium publication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.

The survey data is publicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey). Below, we'll do a quick exploration of the <span style='color:Red'> 2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv  </span> file stored in the `clean-data` folder of the repository we just mentioned. We'll read in the file using the direct link [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/master/clean-data/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv).

### Checking for Sample Representativity
As mentioned in the introduction, most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but it also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. For the purpose of our analysis, we want to answer questions about a population of new coders that are interested in the subjects we teach. We'd like to know:

- Where are these new coders located.
- What locations have the greatest densities of new coders.
- How much money they're willing to spend on learning.

So we first need to clarify whether the data set has the right categories of people for our purpose. The <span style='background :Pink'>JobRoleInterest</span> column describes for every participant the role(s) they'd be interested in working in. If a participant is interested in working in a certain domain, it means that they're also interested in learning about that domain. So let's take a look at the frequency distribution table of this column and determine whether the data we have is relevant.

   ### Final Boxplot

### Choosing the Two Best Markets
Obviously, one country we should advertise in is the US. Lots of new coders live there and they are willing to pay a good amount of money each month (roughly \$143).

We sell subscriptions at a price of \$59 per month, and Canada seems to be the best second choice because people there are willing to pay roughly \$93 per month, compared to India (\$66) and the United Kingdom (\$45).

The data suggests strongly that we shouldn't advertise in the UK, but let's take a second look at India before deciding to choose Canada as our second best choice:

- $59 doesn't seem like an expensive sum for people in India since they spend on average \$66 each month.
- We have almost twice as more potential customers in India than we have in Canada:

     ### Final Frequency Table

So it's not crystal clear what to choose between Canada and India. Although it seems more tempting to choose Canada, there are good chances that India might actually be a better choice because of the large number of potential customers.

At this point, it seems that we have several options:

1. Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:
    - 60% for the US, 25% for India, 15% for Canada.
    - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.
    
2. Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:
    - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.
    - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.
    
3. Advertise only in the US.

At this point, it's probably best to send our analysis to the marketing team and let them use their domain knowledge to decide. They might want to do some extra surveys in India and Canada and then get back to us for analyzing the new survey data.

### Conclusion
In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
